# Elektronz-MCCheats-Client

This is a project which started out of curiosity about how to trick a minecraft server with sending spoofed packets from the client to alter the clients abilities and gain some advantage over other players. REMINDER: This project is not intended to be missused to lower other players gaming experience, it shall only be used on private servers or to learn about minecraft's client-server-communication.

Note: Used Fabric-1.19
